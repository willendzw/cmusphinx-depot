The Logios Tool
----------------
[20080708] (air) updated instructions

Logios allows you to compile a complete set of knowledge files for use
with a spoken language system based on the Sphinx decoder and the
Phoenix parser.

The current version takes a grammar specification as input and
produces files for decoding and parsing. If you want to start from a
corpus of sentences you should continue to use
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html 

Logios provides a complete language compilation chain.


Quick Start
-----------

Logios is currently tested for Windows, however the code should run
on linux if you adapt the CompileLanguage script.

1) copy CompileLanguage.bat to the root of your project
- edit paths and options as per the comments in the script

2) Run: CompileLanguage.bat
Look for log files; locations will vary with the scheme you selected in 1)

That's it.



Extensions to the Phoenix Grammar Specification
-----------------------------------------------

1. You can specify extenal class files using 

	%[CLASSNAME]%

where CLASSNAME implies a CLASSNAME.class file in the GRAMMAR folder.
.class files should have  class item in parentheses, one to a line. 
You should have whitespace (say a tab) to start the line.
For example:

	(firstitem)
	(second item)

You can also specify an item probability:

	(third_item)	#%%0.25%%

Note that all class entries will be tokenized, e.g.:

	(second item) --> (second_item)

This makes entries conform to a constraint in the Sphinx decoder (which
only handles a single lexical item as a class token).
