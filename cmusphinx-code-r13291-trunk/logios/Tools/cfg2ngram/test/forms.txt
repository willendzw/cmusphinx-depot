# GENERIC, TASK-INDEPENDENT SLOTS

# Written by: Dan Bohus, May 2002
# Checked/Updated by: Tina Bennett, May 2002
#
# This is the forms file corresponding to the phoenix grammar for 
# common task-independ constructs (Generic.gra) that we are likely 
# to use in most of the future developed spoken dialog systems. 
#
# HISTORY -------------------------------------------------------
#
# [2002-12-03] (dbohus):    set DateTime as non top-level slot,
#                           renamed date_time (so it no longer
#                           appears in the forms)
# [2002-11-26] (antoine):   set TimeRange and Date as non-top level
#			    slots renamed time_range and date
# [2002-10-14] (dbohus):    Added [Number], by taking it from 
#                           Communicator (erased the old one)
# [2002-09-11] (dbohus):    added [Digit] and [Number], but will 
#                           need to update with all the number
#                           grammar from Communicator
