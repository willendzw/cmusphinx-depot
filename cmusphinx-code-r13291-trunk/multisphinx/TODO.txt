All of the remaining programming work revolves around multisphinx_batch
and getting it in shape to do the experiments that I still need to do:

* search_factory - test case, assume most of what ps_decoder did
  - registry of searches (in search_factory.c)
  - common constructors for searches
* rewrite test cases to use search_factory
* add API for getting segmented results (or use old one)

* need to think a bit about how much i want to do with this though
  - this search_factory thing is necessary i think to make the code more understandable
  - but a real rigorous API maybe not?

* latency measurement
  - add timers and stuff to multisphinx_batch
  - main function of multisphinx_batch will be to measure latency etc
  - add ability to dump multiple results at different stages of processing
  	* e.g. first complete result, after N msec or N% of utterance length
